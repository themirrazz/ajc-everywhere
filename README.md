AJCEverywhere is a native installer, updater, and launcher for [AJ Classic](https://classic.animaljam.com) for operating systems beside Windows/macOS. Unlike other third-party clients, AJCEverywhere aims to provide a *semi-official* experience by using the bundle from the official Windows client with minimal modifications.

## Features
* Uses part of the official client
* Supports automatic updates to game and launcher
* Fast, native performance on Linux
* Compatible with Raspberry Pi 4 and 5

## Installation guide
> [!WARNING]
> AJCEverywhere is still in the public alpha stage! Features may break or be unstable.

TBD

## Usage guide
If you've installed AJCEverywhere from an official source, you'll usually be able to find it in your app launcher (the Start menu on Windows and Launchpad on macOS). Just click on it and it should automatically start downloading the bundle and Flash Player. Once it's done, it'll automatically launch.

If you're building from source, run `npm test`. If you're not on Arch or an Arch-based distro, use the `npm run test-nonarch` command instead.
