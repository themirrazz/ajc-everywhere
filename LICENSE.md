# AJCE Public License v1.0
This project and its source code are licensed under the AJCE Public License v1.0. You can use, distribute, modify, and fork it as long as you follow these terms:
1. Any copies or forks must be licensed under AJCEPLv1.0 or higher - this includes any file that contains source code from this project. If you use code snippets from this in an unrelated project, this doesn't include the files that don't include the code snippets.
2. Binaries compiled from any part of the source are also subject to this license. This doesn't apply to binaries that dynamically load other binaries but weren't compiled from the source.
3. Give credit to the authors. You must include a copy of this license file anywhere you use and share the source code and binaries compiled from it.
4. Don't use this project or its source code to reverse-engineer AJ Classic, except for compatibility/interoperability issues. Hacking, mods, bypasses, and cheats are NEVER allowed.
5. When asked, you must give the full source code to anyone you give or share copies or forks to/with. This doesn't include files that don't include code from this project and that aren't licensed under the AJCE license.
6. Commercial use isn't allowed - this includes selling or renting the source code or compiled binaries, or putting paid ads or subscriptions inside of it. You are allowed to ask users to donate.
7. You cannot put any extra restrictions - technologically or legally - on top of this license, besides a newer and compatible version of the AJCE Public License.
8. The terms of these license do not apply to any source code that is marked with a different license - for example, bundled third-party libraries.
